The creation of conceptual models to represent the structure of data and its relationships within a database.

First Stage -- Database Design 

Now we create conceptual models and define data structure 

Logical data models define the structure of the data elements and their relationships without considering how they will be physically implemented. 
Physical data models translate the logical model into a **schema** that can be implemented in a database, specifying tables, columns, data types, and indexes.
