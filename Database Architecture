#SQL vs Not Only SQL

- NoSQL have dynamic schemas
- Horizontally scalable vs Vertically scalable


##NoSQL 
- Is a type of database that uses non-relational data structures, such as documents, graph databases, and key-value stores to store and retrieve data.
- NoSQL databases are non-relational. 
- You can create documents without having to first define their structure.
- You can use column-oriented, document-oriented, graph-based, or KeyValue stores for your data.


##Database Scaling 

SQL databases are vertically scalable in most situations. That means you can increase the load on a single server by adding more CPU, RAM, or SSD capacity. 

NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can handle higher traffic via a process called sharding, which adds more servers to your NoSQL database.
